Anyway, thought I'd share my first time here (prepare for some mid-to-late-2000s emo cringe): Sophomore year of high school, Southern California, 2007, a new girl comes into seminary, a very cute blonde girl. Our seminary teacher Sister Wilcott introduces her as Jasmine, daughter of the mission president. "Yippee," I say sarcastically to my friend Jacob. На нашем форуме ты можешь обсуждать все, что относится к стилю emo или просто тебя интересует: тусовки, концерты эмо групп, стиль, эмо одежда и прически, а также вечные темы музыки, кино, серой бытовухи, любви.  Sophomore year of high school, Southern California, 2007, a new girl comes into seminary, a very cute blonde girl. Our seminary teacher Sister Wilcott introduces her as Jasmine, daughter of the mission president. "Yippee," I say sarcastically to my friend Jacob, who gave an apt chuckle. "Another Utah Molly Mormon girl," we both nodded pre-judiciously. Fast forward, we realize we were very wrong about her. The three of us actually became good friends in no time, out of a mutual affinity. Дата релиза: 27.10.2017. uploaded by RISEEEEEEE. Список треков: 01. For You 02. Cold War Telescreen 03.

So far, my other playlists are: \-dj0nt (djent and progressive metal/rock) \-mallcore (pop-punk/easycore) \-skramz (screamo) \-whalesong (ambient and post-rock) \-xhxcx (hardcore) \-it's not a phase mom (emo-pop/mall-emo and post-hardcore) \-before it's cool (indie) Give me your best ideas. Жанр : Post-hardcore, emo, emocore, mall emo В городе : Мурманск О группе : Группа образовалась в сентябре 2008 Дмитрием Ковалевым(вокал) и Дмитрием Кроу(наст.фамилия Олейник)(гитара). Emo is starting to become the horrid catch-all it was in the early-mid 00s. From that insipid write-up on Drake's Take Care (https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/5-years-on-drakes-take-care-is-the-greatest-emo-album-of-all-time) to that out-of-touch article on Sonny Moore rejoining From First to Last (https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/from-first-to-last-make-war-emo-2017), emo's resurgence in the indie rock world has finally entered the mainstream, in a really nasty way. Basically 
I have not seen much discussion of music in this sub generally, but it is something I would struggle to exist without. Most of my day is filled with sounds, audio, music etc and it's something that definitely nudges my brain along. My main question relates to what types and/or styles of music you like to listen to (if you do). As general or subsubsubgenre as you wish; artist or composition links very welcome. I've noticed a pattern in my own listening behaviour that tends So, I’m a music major in college. I am doing a Music History project to pick a genre or subgenre and do a paper over its history, along with a playlist to go with it that will be shared with the class for analysis. I chose emo because I love it, and it’s so misunderstood that I want to spread the real deal as much as I can.plus with all the future music educators in my class, it would be super beneficial for them to have an open mind. I am working on a chronological playlist that shows. I listen to emo pretty much exclusively. But ive recently switched to emo trap. Emo trap allows me to feel the same as emo music but now ive started working out and been working towards more goals. Emo trap gives me way more motivation than emo. As a comparison listen to: https://coldhart.bandcamp.com/track/sus-prod-by-nasty-matt Then listen to: Merchant Ships - emo songs The lyrical content is very similar, but the way the message. 
Hey everyone, /u/fart-princess here with the second of a now monthly update post on the projects I head up here on /r/gamegrumps. #Flair and Emotes For those not aware, when I came on to help with flairs we were already at near-max capacity. Reddit allows for about ~350 flair and we had about 330 in total. It's meant that we've had to do some culling - we're looking at one flair per series - but I've used this as an opportunity to make them: higher-quality let you add custom Original Thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4ms6n5/creating_now_thats_what_i_call_rpopheads_week_9/) While some surprising acts didn't make this week's list (Britney, Maroon 5, Pink are just some that didn't make the top 20) the diversity alone is pretty killer. Mall Emo peaks, Rap softens and new pop royalty rises to the top of our choices. Please note some high rated songs didn't make it because 1.) An artist had another song that ranked higher or 2.) A song had appeared. I rarely post about Music on Reddit because I'm really picky. I got into the Get Up Kids around age 12, and from there went down the emo rabbit hole. I had just graduated in 2009 when emo started to get "cool" in my age group. Suddenly everyone was lyk sooooo into Braid and American Football and everyone was talking about all these new bands and calling them emo and I was pretty convinced it was just mall emo 2.0 and ignored everything. So I pretty much haven't listened to any new music. Hey, I was wondering where do I start if I want to get into emo music. I know mostly mall emo but things like Sunny Day Real Estate are really amazing to me. So can someone comment in music I can listen too. Thanks. Oiriginal Thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4kniay/creating_now_thats_what_i_call_rpopheads_week_7/) Being in the middle of the decade it might be cliche to call this a transition year but already the pop landscape looks like it's changing. Less boy band and late 90's pop centric, the ascension of Kanye West would bring on less hard edged rap and Mall Emo makes its first appearance on these lists. Please note some high rated songs didn't make it because 1.) An artist So Adelaide. Yesterday on the hunt for a firm pillow from harris and scarfe, and to my astonishment I spotted 3 young goths, on Rundle Mall, one even had black latex boots on a 35 degree day. Tell me is this an omen? Am I blessed or cursed? I am tending towards blessed because the heat was turned down to a reasonable 25 today, but am I cursed as my student accommodation is playing bureaucracy games and winning at shit prizes.

Found it in 2012 in middle school and it was what really got me into emo music and what made me want to learn about its history after a long past of listening to mall emo. The Anti-Bush game was hilarious, but I don't think it works anymore :( BTW this is my first post on Reddit (ever) so sorry if this isn't done right. I had fun with the last Recut (https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3o0qjt/the_recut_the_bends/) and got a decent response so decided to try my hand again. --- In the year 2015 The Killers are a punchline. Contrast that to a decade ago, a year after the release of their monumental debut and having their song 'Mr. Brightside' crowned the jam of Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter again they were poised to be the biggest band in the world, a goal they painstakingly set upon themselves. So question and opinion time. I'm a fan of emo revival and mall emo/scenecore/whatever you want to call it. So the burning question I have is, is this normal? I ask because it seems to be mostly a shocked answer from many in the scene when I say this. I welcome any answers 
Personally, I think Years & Years (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXTAn4ELEwM) is probably my spirit band. I identify so much with a lot of their lyrics/ band's aesthetic. Their music is the therapy to my internal monologue. It is so liberating and uninhibited (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nJCF01b510) They're not even my favourite band - in terms of sound. but lyrically they are the most poignant in my opinion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3T2RnTBp_4).
