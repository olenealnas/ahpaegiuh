                            <p>I bought Denoiser II and have been playing around with it. I couldn't color correct in real time at all on a clip that had Denoiser II effect on it, so I removed all the effects. My question is - can I apply Denoiser to an application layer in premiere pro and have it effect the clip it overlays? I need a way of using it without bogging my computer down, which shouldn't be happening anyways. What do you prefer for low light scenes and why? Money isn't an issue if you have other recommendations. I used Red Giant's Denoiser II and after I render the clip it just shows media pending. I have let it sit for about 20 minutes with nothing changing so I was wondering if I just need to keep waiting or if its something wrong. I am a beginner with Premiere and Red Giant so I have very little clue what I am doing so forgive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gtT7Zjb--w That was shot on a Canon 6D w/ 24-105 F4 L in technicolor cine-style with all the sharpening/contrast/saturation settings turned down. I did all that in Lumetri Color and also used an unsharp mask + red giant denoiser II to achieve whats seen in that clip. Any feedback would be appreciated please. 
Here is a test footage i made with GH5s C4k, 10 Bit, 422, 400 mpbs, V-log. Metabones speedbooster + ROkinon T1.5 https://youtu.be/CJ7APOcQ-i4 Any idea why so much noise ? -Converted files into MXF OP1A XAVC Intra 4K class 300 3840x2160 - .CUBE lut V-log to REC 709 - Red Giant Denoiser II - Exported h264 bitrate Bought a new macbook pro today: 2.5GHz 16GB Ram 512GB PCIe SSD AMD Discrete 2GB DDR5 GPU I bought this to see if it can satisfy my needs as a filmmaker. I shoot 6-12 minute short films, generally multi-cam(2 cameras) and at most 3-4 streams of 4k, I use RedGiant Denoiser II, Davinci Resolve Lite, and after effects occasionally. I was going to beef up my custom PC for heavy editing, and still may, but I love OSX and my old 15" MBPr, so I want to give it a shot. Checkout my first edit and first night time flight. Just did some test one night as long as my 2 batteries lasted. Shot in 4K and edited on a 1080p timeline. Iso was high and shutters a bit to low from time to time. Denoised with Red Giant Denoiser II Loving this machine :) https://vimeo.com/136199026. I am editing a science video curriculum and we took some slow motion shots on the iPhone 6+. Obviously this was a compromise, but there weren't enough slow motion shots to justify renting a real slow mo camera. SO- has anyone ever worked with this format and done a decent job on noise removal? What did you use? What did you do? I downloaded the demo of Red Giant Denoiser II, and at least at the default settings, it didn't seem to help much- but again, I only ran default settings. Final output. I am working on an animation unfortunately has very grainy volumetrics in the dark areas. It's been three weeks and dozens of hours and I have run out of time to address this in Blender, so I need another option. Red Giant's Denoiser II beautifully removes the grain and results in a great final image, but unfortunately it also removes details I want in some red fabric in the shot. As you can see from the image linked here, the noise is only apparent in the dark areas of the image. In motion Here is my first attempt at putting a part list together. I've never put a build together and have always just worked with Macs but they are a bit too pricey now. Let me know if this even makes sense. any help at all would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! Here is some background on what I plan on doing with it - I primarily do visual effects on short films and indie features typically shot in 4K. As for specific uses of After Effects - I don't typically. 
Hi All, A friend of mine passed away unexpectedly last weekend. I have a video of her singing that I would like to pass on to her friends and family. It was shot with a C300 in C-Log and without proper lighting. I was able to improve it in After Effects with some color correction and Red Giant's Denoiser II. But I'm not an expert colorist. This was a beautiful lady, this video can't do her justice but can anyone here do a better job than I did? My before and after screenshots below What does /r/editors think about Red Giant Denoiser II ( vs Neat Video ( I've used Denoiser II with very good result, but man is it slow. How is the render speed with Neat Video vs Denoiser II? As for price they seem very close. To the best of my knowledge one license for Denoiser II works for both Premiere Pro and After effects. However Neat video is  per application, making. I have been working independently to improve my video production skills but recently hit a wall. I produced this video and am happy because it's technically one of the best I've produced (the content and audio are junk, I've been focusing on the image). However, I am still struggling with a number of items that I could use your help with (if you'd be so kind as to share it). Any thoughts regarding my specific issues or general feedback is appreciated. Thank you! THE VIDEO -- https://www.you. Anyone have any opinions on the best De-noiser for footage? Something I'm working on looks great colorwise but I'm afraid I pushed it too far and I'm now seeing a ton of noise in the image. I'm downloading Red Giant's DenoiserII demo now, but I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for something that might either: A work better B be cheaper Thanks. Hello! I am trying to render a film but keep getting an odd error that seems to stem from using Red Giant's DeNoiser II software it reads as such: "A low level exception occurred in: Denoiser II" Anyone ever run into this? Will appreciate any advice. My Boss said we just got some money for plugs. I can't really think of any. Currently I have: Red Giant Magic Bullet, Denoiser II, LUT Buddy, and Universe LRT timelapse (Not exactly a premiere plug in) Film looks and something called HitFilm which is basically Universe. Is there any other plugins you guys would recommend. 
As the title explains, I am having a hell of a time rendering and exporting in Adobe Premiere CS6. I've been editing videos and movies for nearly 10 years now, so I LIKE to think I know what I'm doing. But starting a month ago, my render and export times have gotten a little ridiculous. I'm editing a 20 minute video, 1080p, 24fps, that has little, to no effects added. (RGB Curves, and some framing tweaks only) I'm exporting to H.264, with the maximum render quality box checked. And it's taking.
